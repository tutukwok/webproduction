            <h2>Destinations</h2>
            <p>I've loved traveling ever since I was young. Be it domestically or internationally, I find great intrerest in learning about different culures and learning new languages. Coming from family where my father and mother are of different culture, it allows me to be more open and adventurous with trying new food, explore, and be out of my comfort zone.</p>
